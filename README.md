# Assignment-7-Data-Differences

<html>

I would like to create an artist page for my band. This page will give users access to previous performances on YouTube, a short bio, and a "contact us" button, which will directly send messages to our mailbox. I believe I'll need to save data, so I'll probably be using the data store API that this course will provide. (We currently have only a few videos on YouTube.)

The users will most likely be those who inquire our (future) business cards after live performances. They want to learn more about our band, hear us play from past shows, and contact us for future performances. I'll be using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and whatever else is necessary to pull this off. Advice + help is always appreciated!! :)
